    <div id = "intro"><p> Humanitarianism, technology and female empowerment are some of my biggest passions and I do my best to marry these topics wherever I can! One of these ways is through my summer course and membership at Girls Who Code where I’ll be completing various projects and exploring the ways that technology can be used for social good. After a year of volunteer work with the Calgary Food Bank and volunteering at various events with the Calgary Humane Society, I’ve decided to bring my passion for humanitarianism to my community, and I will be starting a Youth Volunteer Society in the fall! I’m currently working with local organizations like the Mustard Seed and the Rockyview General Hospital to give young people better access to volunteer opportunities, while alleviating the stress put on these organizations following the COVID-19 Pandemic. I’m a founding member and team lead in STEM-E's Mentoring program, where I help connect students interested in STEM with mentors who can guide their learning, and advancement in the field. I’m also the Vice President of Operations at Opportunify, an organization dedicated to empowering youth across Canada with opportunities to volunteer, learn, and impact their community as they move towards their post secondary goals. </p>

      <p>
        STEM isn’t the only thing I’m into! I’m also a Sergeant in the Royal Canadian Air Cadets where I teach classes on aeronautics, citizenship and leadership, and participate in a variety of volunteering and ceremonial activities. I'm also an avid book-reader, and I love spending my mornings reading e-books on the train ride to work. When I’m not busy with my extracurricular goals, you can find me competing in hackathons, caring for my plants, or going thrifting with my friends!
