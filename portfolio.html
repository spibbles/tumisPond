        <img id= "cc" src = "portfolio/cconnects.jpg" alt = "This is the Calgary Connects homepage - a website i designed for a hadckathon I participated in this summer!">
       
        <p>  This is a website I designed and built for Calgary's Biggest Hackathon 2022. Our goal was to create a platform for tourists, newcomers or calgarians just trying to explore downtwon, to connect with experienced locals and tour guides who were interested in helping them explore the city. The backend portion uses a geolocator and my City's API to populate the site with local events</p>
